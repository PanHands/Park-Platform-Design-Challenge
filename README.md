# Park-Platform-Design-Challenge
Design documents for mobile park searching application.

We chose to create an application focused on searching for parks. It was important to us that the search included numerous accessibility features. We wanted every user to be able to find the park that would meet their needs.
Our initial design was inconsistent in its presentation. The feedback we were given mostly told us that pushing our whole design towards a more cohesive whole was the main things we needed to implement.
The main focus of the design was centered around the search. The whole application is centered around the search, and presumably a user would spend the majority of their time using the search to find a park that fits specific criteria. We wanted the act of searching for a park to feel effortless. This choice pushed us from dense text heavy designs that could be difficult to parse on a mobile device, to one of simplicity. Through the use of icons and the layout of our designs a user should be able to understand the basics of what a park has at a glance. If need be the user can get detailed information about the amenities/accessibility features a park might have at a touch.

The initial feedback we recieved led us to a design that was more cohesive in nature. We reformatted the structure of the design elements and created a color pallette for parity across all pages. 

Overall, This mobile app will offer a thorough visual representation of park-related data, such as user reviews, accessibility features, location information, and issue reporting. Its goal is to improve the user experience by providing a user-friendly interface for park exploration and feedback submission.
